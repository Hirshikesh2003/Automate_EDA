# OUTPUT:
It starts with the basic information of the dataset, includes the count of the non-null values, and the data type of the columns.
Then it undergoes a simple cleaning process where the null values are replaced with '0'
Now, we'll start to get the visualizations which includes bar chart and pie chart depending on the data. Following to each visualization, there will be a statistical description of the column.

# Pie Chart
